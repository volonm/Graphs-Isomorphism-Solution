# Graph-Isomorphism-Solution
 Optimized Solution to the famous Graphs Isomorphism Problem


Graph Problem Solver
To solve graph problems using this program, follow these steps:

Run main_solver: The main entry point for solving graph problems is the main_solver function.
 Within this function, you'll find various function calls designed to address specific instances.

Graph Isomorphism and Automorphism  Solver :
Use the function solve_graph_isomorphisms("basic/basic01GI.grl", False)
to solve Graph Isomorphism (GI) and Graph Automorphism (GIAUT) problems.
The second argument is a boolean value indicating whether to calculate and print the number of
automorphisms in the given graph group.

Automorphism Problem Solver:
Utilize the function solve_aut('basic/basic05Aut.grl') to solve the automorphism
problem for a specific graph.
